## Summary of the first day

This is my first day of the second round of #100DaysOfCode.

I'll code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.

The first subtask of the day was to create a new online presence with a blog to track my progress.

For this project, I choose Gatsby, an open-source framework with performance, scalability, and security built-in.

I'll swap the theme for another one during the challenge. The secret drafts are stored on Figma.com already.

The second part of the task consisted of registering for the JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos.

Today I built the JavaScript drum computer, but I haven't finished it yet.
My skills for this challenge are to improve my skills and to build many projects.
